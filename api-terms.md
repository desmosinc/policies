The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information in the manner provided herein for five (5) years after receipt thereof, unless such obligation ceases earlier pursuant to this Section or for so long as such Confidential Information may remain a trade secret.

## 11. General Terms

a. <u>Choice of Law and Arbitration.</u> These Terms shall be governed by the laws of California without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. In the event of any dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in San Francisco, California. Arbitration will be under the auspices of, and pursuant to the rules of, the American Arbitration Association's Commercial Arbitration Rules as then in effect, or such other procedures as the parties may agree to at the time, before a single arbitrator. Arbitration must be concluded within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the Arbitrator or such other time as agreed to by the parties. Any award issued as a result of such arbitration shall be final and binding between the parties, and shall be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the party against whom enforcement is sought. A ruling by the arbitrator shall be non-appealable. Desmos Studio and you agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. Either Desmos Studio or you may cause an arbitration proceeding to commence by giving the other party notice in writing of such arbitration. Desmos Studio and you covenant and agree to act as expeditiously as practicable in order to resolve all disputes by arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11(a), in the event of an alleged violation of a party's intellectual property rights, that party may seek a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time prior to the appointment of an arbitrator.

b. <u>Relationship of Parties.</u> The parties hereto are independent contractors, and no agency, employment, partnership, fiduciary, or joint venture relationship is intended or created by these Terms. Neither party (nor any agent or employee of that party) is the representative of the other party for any purpose and neither party has the power or authority as agent, employee, or in any other capacity to represent, act for, bind, or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. No party will be deemed as a third-party beneficiary to these Terms or any provision herein.

c. <u>U.S. Government Restricted Rights.</u> Any software and related documentation provided by Desmos Studio hereunder is a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire such software and related documentation with only those rights set forth therein.

d. <u>Amendment.</u> No modification of these Terms or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon the parties unless approved in writing by each of the parties.

e. <u>No Waiver.</u> The failure of either party to enforce at any time the provisions of these Terms shall not be constituted to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the ability of either party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.

f. <u>Severability.</u> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable at law, such provision will be deemed stricken from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect and be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

g. <u>Assignment.</u> You may not assign or transfer these Terms, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void. We reserve the right to assign these Terms in whole or in part to any third party without further notice to you. No permitted assignment shall relieve either party of responsibility for the performance of any obligations of such party accrued prior to said assignment.

h. <u>Entire Agreement.</u> These Terms represent the entire Agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior understanding, agreements, or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof.

## 12. Modification

We may modify these Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Software Service. You should look at these Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to the Terms within the Documentation and/or to this website. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective to existing customers no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for a Software Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for a Software Service, you should discontinue your use of that Software Service. Your continued use of the Software Service constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.
