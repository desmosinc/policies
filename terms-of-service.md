## 5. Special Terms for Educators

a. *Fees*. If Desmos makes any Desmos Service (e.g., the Desmos Graphing Calculator or the Desmos Activity Builder) available to Educators for academic use in individual classes with students without charging a fee, then Desmos will not thereafter charge Educators a fee to use such existing Desmos Service for such purpose.  The foregoing will not, however, prohibit Desmos from charging a fee for any new Desmos Services that are complementary to, or may be used together with, such existing Desmos Service.

b. *Activity Sharing*. At the time you, as an Educator, submit to Desmos an activity you’ve developed using the Desmos Activity Builder (an “**Activity**”), you may elect to make your Activity public. If you do so, then you expressly authorize Desmos to (i) make your Activity available to other Educators for use in individual classes with other students, (ii) allow other Educators to copy and modify your Activity and use the modified version in individual classes with other students and (iii) modify your Activity and make the modified version available to other Educators for use in individual classes with other students. In the case of any such use of your Activity (whether unmodified or modified), you will receive an attribution credit. If you elect to make your Activity public, in no event will Desmos authorize any third party to sell your Activity to others, or to otherwise use your Activity for commercial purposes, without your permission.

c. *Parental Consent*. If you are an Educator that requires or encourages the use of the Desmos Services by your students, you represent and warrant that you have obtained any legally required parental consent for the use of the Desmos Services by your students, including with respect to Desmos’ collection of personal information of your students in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

## 12. **Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability**

**a. You agree that use of the Desmos services is at your sole risk. The Desmos services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Desmos expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, with respect to the Desmos services and all services provided by any of our partner (whether api partners, linked partners, or otherwise), including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use or purpose, and non-infringement. You acknowledge that access to data and materials (including, but not limited to, your or others’ user submissions and generated materials) available through the Desmos services is not guaranteed and that Desmos will not be responsible to you for any loss of data or materials caused by the Desmos services or their unavailability.

**b. Under no circumstances will Desmos or its officers, employees, directors, shareholders, agents, or licensors be liable under any theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, statutory, or otherwise) for any damages whatsoever, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of money, revenues, profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if such parties were advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your (or anyone using your account's) use of the Desmos services.**

**c.

## 15. Miscellaneous

These Terms and our Privacy Policy, together with any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Desmos Services (e.g., terms relating to the payment of fees for certain Desmos Services), constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and Desmos with respect to the subject matter hereof, and govern your use of the Desmos Services, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between you and Desmos with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and the relationship between you and Desmos will be governed by the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements made, entered into, and performed entirely in California by California residents, notwithstanding your actual place of residence. All lawsuits arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Desmos Services will be brought in the Federal or State courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose. The failure of Desmos to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of Desmos and you as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Desmos Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Desmos Services.  If access to the Desmos Services is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Desmos Services will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” pursuant to DFARS Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, respectively, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Desmos Services and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms.
