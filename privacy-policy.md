<h2 id="student-data">2. Student Data</h2>

**Summary**: If you or your School provides us with Student Data via Desmos Classroom, your School is acting as the data controller for the Student Data, and our processing of such Student Data is governed by our agreements with your School.  Such agreements may impose greater obligations on Desmos than described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Desmos Classroom services may be used by third party providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, school systems, teachers or other instructors (collectively referred to as "**Schools**").

When Desmos contracts with a School to provide a Service through student.desmos.com to students of the School (“**Students**”), we may have access to Student Data (defined below). We consider Student Data to be highly confidential and our processing of Student Data is governed by our Student Data Privacy Statement, our Terms of Service and/or our written agreements with the applicable School.

Please see our [Student Data Privacy Statement](https://www.desmos.com/studentdata) for additional information about how we collect and use Student Data gathered during the provision of the Desmos Service to Schools.

If you represent a School in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, you can review our standard, template DPA with attached SCCs here. If the School  would like to enter into that DPA (and attached SCCs) with us, please send an email to [privacy-gdpr@desmos.com](mailto:privacy-gdpr@desmos.com), with the following information about the school: (i) name, (ii) address, (iii) telephone number, (iv) signatory name, (v) signatory title, and (vi) signatory email address, and (vii) teacher.desmos.com account usernames. We will then send the school’s signatory a copy of the DPA for electronic signatures via Docusign or equivalent, and arrange for signature by Desmos’ authorized representative.

<h2 id="information-collected">3. Information Collected</h2>

**Summary**: We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us such as name, email.

a. *Personal Data You Disclose to Us*.
You can use most of our Services, including the Desmos Tools, and, as a student, Desmos Classroom, without registering for an account with Desmos. If you choose to create an account on the Service, or communicate with Desmos, you may provide to Desmos certain information by which someone could personally identify you, such as your name, email or unique username (“**Personally Identifiable Information**”), passwords and similar information used for authentication and account access (“**Security Information**”), as well as information about yourself such as your employment or level of schooling by which someone could not personally identify you (“**Demographic Information**”). When we link Security Information or Demographic Information to your Personally Identifiable Information, we treat all of it as Personally Identifiable Information. We also collect information (i) when you save or post content to the Service, (ii) if you expressly authorize us to access your device camera and photo roll to upload pictures to the Service, and (iii) and if you communicate with us via email or otherwise.

We refer to all of this data collectively as “**Personal Data**”. We may also collect limited Personal Data about you from a third party Internet site or service. For example, if you login to your Desmos account through Google or another authentication tool, or if you interact with Desmos on social media, we may collect the Personal Data you authorize that third party service to share with us, such as email address or name.

We do **not** knowingly collect: (i) exact geolocation data, (ii) behavioral data for advertising purposes, (iii) biometric / health data, or (iv) sensitive data, as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (including, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation).

Summary: Some information – such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our websites or apps.

b. *Usage Data*.
We automatically collect certain technical usage information when you use our Service (“**Usage Data**”). Usage Data includes the information that your web browser or mobile application automatically sends to our servers whenever you visit. The Usage Data collected in our logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email. Typically, this information is collected through log files, web beacons, browser cookies, or other device identifiers that may uniquely identify your browser or device. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse all cookies, and your mobile device to not provide your mobile device identifier. You may not be able to
<!-- TODO Link 'Desmos Cookie Policy' to the desmos cookie policy. -->
delete or disable cookies on certain mobile devices and/or certain browsers.

In addition, our Service may use third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, Google Analytics and Bugsnag) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users and bugs in our Services. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user. If we do so, we will treat such combined data as Personal Data.

Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider.
