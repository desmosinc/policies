# California Privacy Rights Statement

This California Privacy Rights Statement (this “**Statement**”) explains how Desmos, Inc. ("**Desmos**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in our capacity as a “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). This Statement also explains California residents’ rights under the CCPA and California Civil Code section 1798.83 (the "**Shine the Light law**”).

## Scope

For purposes of this Statement, unless a different definition is noted, "Personal Information" has the definition given in the CCPA. However, this Statement does not apply to:

- Information exempted from the scope of the CCPA;
- Personal Information we collect from individuals acting in their capacities as representatives of organizations solely in the context of conducting due diligence regarding, or providing or receiving a product or service to or from, such organizations; or
- Personal Information we collect, use, and share on behalf of our customers (including Schools) as a "service provider" under the CCPA for purposes of providing our services to them.

## Your California Privacy Rights under the CCPA

You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:

- The categories of Personal Information we have collected.
- The categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information.
- The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.

## How to Exercise Your Rights

You may submit requests to exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:

- Right to information, access, and deletion. If you are a California resident, you may submit a request to exercise your information, access, and deletion rights by emailing [privacy@desmos.com](mailto:privacy@desmos.com).
- Right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information. We do not sell your personal information.

These rights are not absolute, and in some instances, we may decline your request as permitted by law. We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access, and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to log into your Desmos account (if applicable), provide government identification, give a declaration as to your identity under penalty of perjury, and/or provide additional information.

Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent's identity and our receipt of a copy of the valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
